Swift over Coffee is a fun, information-packed podcast for Swift developers from [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) and [Erica Sadun](https://twitter.com/ericasadun) – [you should give it a try](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/swift-over-coffee/id1435076502)!

We issued our first challenge in S2E3, and many folks are responding with their own solutions. We want these solutions to be read by as many folks as possible, because it's a great learning opportunity for everyone, so this repo will serve as a way to track solutions listeners have submitted.

**If you want to add your own repo:** Awesome! Please use a pull request, and put your name and link at the *end* of the list for the appropriate episode. You don't need to solve just the newest challenge – you can tackle any you want.
